git/apps/smsbiljett/main.java is point of entry

See main.java on how to use info.txt

Tickets are stored in /tickets, and they all extend the Ticket base class, use other tickets as reference

Do not upload info.txt without proper formatting, will cause crash (dont fix that, being able to crash clients may come in handy)

Code is built like lego, bit by bit, so it's in really bad shape
